# FACT-FUSION

## Overview

Fact Fusion is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. This platform allows users to read facts and their sources, react to them as good, mind-blowing, or false, and view facts by specific categories. Additionally, users can contribute by posting new facts via a simple form.
